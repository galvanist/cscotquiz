UZ has taken on the programme under the same Artistic Director, Neil Butler and wishes to create a rolling programme of residency opportunities for Scottish artists at Suramedura, Sri Lanka.  Artists will be selected through an advertised application process.  The selection panel will consist of artistic associates UZ Arts who have had previous residencies in Sri Lanka.The criteria for selection is that the work is informed and inspired by the environment of Suramedura.  Work must be socially and culturally unique to Sri Lanka and in particular Suramedura.  Each artist will also need to demonstrate the impact a residency will have on their personal and artistic development.  Suramedura offers accommodation, studio spaces, both indoor and outdoor (some sheltered) use of tools and access to a network of local makers and artists.  Successful applicants will learn how to work in a vulnerable environment through mentoring by UZ Art_s Artistic Director Neil Butler who has a long standing relationship with Sri Lanka and the local community.\nAn important aspect of this residency programme is engagement with the local community artists are encouraged to share their work and practice with the local community or alternatively can opt to commit one day per week to work with communities teaching English delivering workshops etc.  An additional development of this programme is an artists exchange programme in partnership with Cove Park, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.  Selected Sri Lankan artists will be invited to Cove Park for a 6 week residency.
