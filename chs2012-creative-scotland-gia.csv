We aim to provide an opportunity for writers who, for family, work or other commitments, cannot undertake longer term residencies to take time out from those commitments to further their creative development and perhaps take a first step in a writing career.  The main stakeholders in the project will be the writer and the host community.  We hope that from the experience of living and working at Brownsbank the writer will learn more about his or her own limitations and potential as a working artist and creative writing practitioner.  We hope that the presence of a series of writers and creative writing practitioners in the host community will promote creative writing as an accessible participatory artform, and literature generally, in a rural area which has several significant literary connections, not least the cottage itself, which is the former home of Hugh MacDiarmid and a ?living? museum of national literary significance."

The Fellowship covers the costs of all tuition, accommodation, most meals, the social and cultural programme and includes full use of the facilities of the library of Edinburgh University and the National Library of Scotland.  It does not include travel expenses or spending money.
The translator attends the daily lectures and seminars for all three modules we currently offer (Modernism, Scottish Literature, Contemporary Literature).  S/he also contributes a Translation Workshop for our literature and creative writing students (which runs in the last three weeks of SUISS in parallel to the Literature modules), meets with the literature portfolio manager in Creative Scotland to discuss further collaborations and visits the Edinburgh International Book festival to explore further possibilities for translations.
Since 2004, when the fellowship was first established with the generous support of Scottish Arts Council, the selection process has been very competitive and we have welcomed to Scotland translators from Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Croatia, Portugal, Italy and China.  The fellowship bears the name of Edwin Morgan to honour his six decades of work in translation.
Applicants are asked to include a letter explaining their reasons for applying, together with any details of past and/or prospective publications plus a reference letter, normally from the candidates publisher.  In 2011 our Edwin Morgan Creative Writing Fellow was Ian Rankin?s Chinese Translator, Jenny Lu, who had a rich record of publications and left Scotland with a list of contacts and ideas for projects of translating Scottish fiction in Chinese.  Jenny met with Ian Rankin and arranged to translate his Exit Music."

Proposing to offer an international 8 week interdisciplinary residency involving 4 glass artists/artists working in other media.  We plan to involve a partner organisation to encourage experimental collaboration and maximise learning and skills development opportunities for the artists.  Use a model developed from a 2 venue partnership pilot residency with Scottish Sculpture Workshop this autumn.
Aim to provide an opportunity for artists to work in glass and other media as a way of broadening the audience for creative glass.  Want to create a supported yet experimental environment where artists can engage with new directions for their work, collaborate and exchange ideas skills and techniques develop their expertise and challenge their practice.
Creative glass is an increasingly underrepresented art form and craft practice.  The more we can engage artists in the possibilities of expression through glass alongside other media, the more we can secure a dynamic future for creative glass practice.  Glass making is an ancient skill and craft, we hope those involved in the project will learn techniques which will enable them to push their work in new directions.
The applicant hopes the glass artists will seek to incorporate other media into their work as a result and the artists working in other media will understand the possibilities presented by glass and incorporate it into their work."
Robert Louis Stevenson Fellowships 2012,28/11/2011,12250,Talent Development,Creative Futures,RLS Fellowship 2012,Edinburgh,EH9 1TP,Lothian,"The aim of the RLS Fellowship is to send a number of writers from Scotland for a residency at the Hotel Chevillon, International Arts Centre in France where Robert Louis Stevenson spent time as a young man.
The chosen writers will result from a competitive application and applicants will submit around 3000 words of their own work.  In addition they are also asked to submit a brief literary biography details of publication or performance in the case of playwrights and a short statement outlining the proposed project and their need to go on a residency in order to develop this project.
Each of the successful Fellows will spend a month, approximately at the Hotel Chevillon International Arts Centre in order to develop the new project.  These Fellows are chosen from the list of applicants by a panel which is chaired by the RLS Fellowship Project Manager and those chosen can be novelists short story writers, poets playwrights or writers of non fiction such as travel or biography.
Another important aspect of this residency is its truly international flavour.  Chevillon is in France but run by a Swedish Foundation and many artists (writers, painters, sculptors) from Finland and Sweden go to residencies at Chevillon.
Thus this project not only supports Scottish writers in an international artistic environment but also promotes Scottish writing abroad and encourages artistic collaborations and international development."

UZ Arts,12/12/2011,8000,Talent Development,Creative Futures,UZ/Suramedura Residency Programme,Glsgow,G1 5HZ,Glasgow,"The UZ/Suramedura Residency Programme has evolved from a successful programme at Chandrasevana, Si Lanka, a centre which was set up to support local communities through arts and culture subsequent to the tsunami in 2004.  The initial residency programme was supported through funding from the Hikkaduwa Area Relief Fund, which no longer exists, and through support from Glasgow based organisations including Scottish Arts Council and Glasgow School of Art.  UZ has taken on the programme under the same Artistic Director, Neil Butler and wishes to create a rolling programme of residency opportunities for Scottish artists at Suramedura, Sri Lanka.  Artists will be selected through an advertised application process.  The selection panel will consist of artistic associates UZ Arts who have had previous residencies in Sri Lanka.The criteria for selection is that the work is informed and inspired by the environment of Suramedura.  Work must be socially and culturally unique to Sri Lanka and in particular Suramedura.  Each artist will also need to demonstrate the impact a residency will have on their personal and artistic development.  Suramedura offers accommodation, studio spaces, both indoor and outdoor (some sheltered) use of tools and access to a network of local makers and artists.  Successful applicants will learn how to work in a vulnerable environment through mentoring by UZ Art?s Artistic Director Neil Butler who has a long standing relationship with Sri Lanka and the local community.
An important aspect of this residency programme is engagement with the local community artists are encouraged to share their work and practice with the local community or alternatively can opt to commit one day per week to work with communities teaching English delivering workshops etc.  An additional development of this programme is an artists exchange programme in partnership with Cove Park, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.  Selected Sri Lankan artists will be invited to Cove Park for a 6 week residency.  UZ will offer further networking opportunities within Scotland."

Arts & Business Scotland,12/12/2011,35500,Talent Development,Creative Futures,Creativity at Work,Edinburgh,EH3 7LB,Lothian,"Proposal to create 10x residencies in Scottish companies.  Each will involve a single artist in a chosen medium being resident for 20 days.  A fee structure of ?300 a day will allow us to attract and place artists with a good reputation.
To encourage companies to participate we wish to offer 50% of the artists cost through funding from CS with the company covering the other 50% (plus any travel and accommodation).
A&BS will consult with interested businesses to develop their residency plan and will work with its arts membership to source the appropriate artists to deliver the residency.  
In these residencies artists learn from engaging with a new audience whilst honing and developing their own practice.  For the businesses, residencies challenge emplyee perceptions of their own attitudes and skills as well as opinions of their employer and colleagues creating fresh debate and often impacting on the culture of the organisation itself."
